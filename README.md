# Sprite Shatter

**Sprite Shatter** is a simple demonstration of an [SKSpriteNode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skspritenode) extension for creating a 'shattering' or explosion effect on a singular node by visually breaking it apart into smaller pieces.

The technique is basic but can be used for some fun effects. The extension is written in Swift, and an earlier version of the `shatter()` function was used in [Rogue Assassin](http://sound-of-silence.com/ra/).
